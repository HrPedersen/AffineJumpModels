The following project contains source code to compute the characteristic
functions, price call options, and calibrate parameters to a dataset for the
three affine jump diffuion models:
	1. The Heston Stochastic Volatility Model,
	2. The Merton Jump Diffusion Model,
	3. The Bates Stochastic Volatility Jump Model.
	
The dependencies are
	1. The Alglib library: http://www.alglib.net/
	2. The Boost library: https://www.boost.org/
	3. Peter JÃ¤ckel's open source implementation from his article 
		"Let's be rational" : http://www.jaeckel.org/
